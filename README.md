# Parallelism of Monte Carlo Simulation ðŸŽ²

This repository explores the parallelism of Monte Carlo Simulation, focusing on the Crude Monte Carlo Method. We've adopted the source code originally created by ALXCHU and made modifications to narrow our focus to the Crude Monte Carlo Method. We've implemented three different types of parallelism techniques:

- OpenMP ðŸš€
- PPL ðŸŒŸ
- TaskFlow ðŸ“Š
